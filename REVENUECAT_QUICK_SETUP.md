# RevenueCat Quick Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Current Status

Your app is now successfully connected to RevenueCat! The error you're seeing is expected:

```
Empty offerings. Please make sure you've configured offerings correctly in the RevenueCat dashboard
```

This means RevenueCat is working, but you need to configure your products and offerings.

## üß™ Testing Without Real Products

Since you're in development mode, you can use **test products** that don't require App Store Connect or Google Play Console setup:

### Option 1: Use RevenueCat's Test Product

RevenueCat provides test product IDs that work immediately:

**iOS Test Product ID**: `rc_promo_pro_monthly`
**Android Test Product ID**: `rc_promo_pro_monthly`

Update your offering in RevenueCat to use these test product IDs temporarily.

### Option 2: Skip Offerings for Now

You can test the integration without offerings by manually setting Pro status. Let me show you how:

## üîß Temporary Workaround: Test Pro Features

While you're setting up RevenueCat, you can temporarily bypass the paywall to test Pro features:

### Option A: Update the paywall to show a message

I can update the paywall screen to show a helpful message when no offerings are found, with a "Continue Anyway" button for testing.

### Option B: Manually grant Pro access

You can manually log in a user to RevenueCat and grant them Pro access through the RevenueCat dashboard.

---

## üì± Expected Flow After Setup

Once you've configured offerings:

1. Open the app and navigate to `/paywall`
2. You should see your offering(s) with price and description
3. Tap "Subscribe" ‚Üí Native payment sheet appears
4. Complete test purchase (no real charge with sandbox account)
5. Pro features unlock automatically

## üéØ Quick Summary Checklist

- [ ] Create entitlement: `pro`
- [ ] Create product: `lotus_pro_monthly` (iOS and/or Android)
- [ ] Link product to entitlement `pro`
- [ ] Create offering: `default`
- [ ] Add package (Monthly) with `lotus_pro_monthly`
- [ ] Set offering as "Current"
- [ ] Refresh app to see offerings

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "Empty offerings"?

1. **Check offering is set as "Current"** in RevenueCat dashboard
2. **Verify product IDs match exactly**: `lotus_pro_monthly`
3. **Verify entitlement ID matches exactly**: `pro`
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for RevenueCat cache to update
5. **Restart the app** to fetch fresh offerings

### Want to test immediately?

I can create a modified paywall screen that:
- Shows a mock product when offerings are empty
- Allows you to test the UI flow
- Simulates Pro access for testing

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

**Choose one:**

### Option 1: Set Up Real Offerings (Recommended)
Follow the steps above to configure offerings in RevenueCat dashboard. This is the proper way and takes ~10 minutes.

### Option 2: Use Test Mode (Quick)
I can modify the paywall to work in "test mode" so you can see the UI and test Pro features while you're setting up RevenueCat.
