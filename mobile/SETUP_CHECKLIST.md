## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: "Invalid API key"
**Fix:** You used the wrong key type. Use SDK keys (goog_xxx), not public API key

### Issue: "No products found"
**Fix:** Products take 2-4 hours to propagate. Wait and try again.

### Issue: Products show but can't purchase
**Fix:**
1. App must be signed with release key
2. App must be uploaded to Play Console
3. You must be a tester in Internal Testing track

### Issue: Purchase works but no webhook
**Fix:**
1. Check webhook URL is correct
2. Verify authorization header in backend
3. Check backend is publicly accessible
4. Look at RevenueCat â†’ Integrations â†’ Webhook history

### Issue: "Singleton instance" error
**Fix:** Check app.json has correct keys, restart app completely
